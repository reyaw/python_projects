# Smaller Projects
This is where I store small-sized projects that do not need their own repositories.

Rune Quiz: A randomized multiple choice quiz run in the console, that tests the user on their knowledge of Elder Futhark runes. Currently being converted into a web application.

Sudoku Solver: Uses a recursive backtracking function to solve sudoku puzzles of any difficulty.
